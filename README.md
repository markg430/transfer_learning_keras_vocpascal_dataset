# Transfer Learning with TF and Keras

Transfer Learning and Image Classifier with Keras - PASCAL VOC Dataset 

## About

This script preprocesses the locally downloaded PASCAL VOC 2007 Dataset and seperates the objects in their respective subfolders.
The pretrained image classifier model provided by Tensorflow is used for transfer learning while the PASCAL VOC dataset as it provides more generalised classes for image classification compared to ImageNet.

The following classifiers have been looked into:

- EfficientNet-b0
- MobileNetV2
